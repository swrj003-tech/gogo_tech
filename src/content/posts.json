Here is how to tame it:\n\n1.  **Monitor Idling:** Excessive idling wastes huge amounts of fuel. Use our telematics integration to track it.\n2.  **Proper Tire Pressure:** Under-inflated tires increase consumption by up to 5%.\n3.  **Regular Maintenance:** A well-tuned engine burns cleaner and more efficiently.\n4.  **Route Optimization:** Use GPS to find the shortest, least congested paths.\n5.  **GoGo On-Site Delivery:** Eliminate the detour to the gas station and reduce driver downtime.\n\nContact our B2B team to learn how our platform automates these savings."
